## Starterkit Boilerplate

A front-end boilerplate for rapid development on any web interface using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/), [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) (templating), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (task automation).

`yarn` to install dependencies

`yarn dev` for development

`yarn build` for production

`yarn deploy` for production (w/o sourcemaps)

Working files are located in the `app` folder

### Under the hood:

1. SASS

-   base - general classes eg h1,h2 etc
-   components - component classes eg. buttons, carousels, navs etc
-   layouts - page layouts that form structure eg. footer, header etc
-   pages - page structure classes eg. services page
-   utilities - utility classes. eg variables, custom properties etc
-   vendors - external libraries.

2. Gulp
3. Babel
4. [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
5. [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select)

Also to mention that this has been heavily inspired by [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/).
